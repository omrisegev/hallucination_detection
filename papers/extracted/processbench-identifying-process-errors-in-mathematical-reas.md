Abstract
As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated
identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for
their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce PROCESSBENCH for measuring the
ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test
cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test
case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts.
Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that
all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on PROCESSBENCH, involving two
types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we
prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two
main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging
math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e.,
prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly
fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview,
has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o,
despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope PROCESS-
BENCH can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way
toward scalable oversight of language models.

Introduction
In recent years, language models have made remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematics and programming (Hurst et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024; Yang et al., 2024a;b; Dubey et al., 2024;
Wake et al., 2024), yet they still make mistakes when solving challenging problems. To achieve scalable
oversight (Amodei et al., 2016; Bowman et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2024), i.e., effectively supervising AI
systems that get close to or go beyond broadly human-level performance, particularly in complex tasks
that are difficult for general humans, we expect language models can identify errors in their reasoning
process in an automated way. However, existing benchmarks related to assessing language models’
reasoning process may be hard to satisfy the growing evaluation demand for the error identification
ability. Either their covered problems have become less challenging for recent language models (Zhou
et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2023), or they merely label the correctness of final answers but lack annotations
for specific erroneous steps (Lin et al., 2024).

"To find the integer \\(n\\), \\(0 \\leq n \\leq 180\\), such that \\(\\cos n^\\circ = \\cos
568^\\circ\\), we can use the periodic properties of the cosine function. First, recall that
the cosine function has a period of \\(360^\\circ\\). This means that: \\[ \\cos \\theta =
\\cos (\\theta + 360k) \\] for any integer \\(k\\).",
"Given \\(\\cos 568^\\circ\\), we need to reduce this angle to an equivalent angle within the
first cycle of \\(0\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\). We do this by subtracting multiples of
\\(360^\\circ\\) until we get an angle within this range: \\[ 568^\\circ - 360^\\circ =
208^\\circ \\] So, \\(\\cos 568^\\circ = \\cos 208^\\circ\\).",
"However, we want to find \\(n\\) such that \\(0 \\leq n \\leq 180\\). Since cosine is also
symmetric about \\(180^\\circ\\), we know that: \\[ \\cos \\theta = \\cos (180^\\circ -
\\theta) \\] Therefore, \\(\\cos 208^\\circ = \\cos (180^\\circ - 208^\\circ)\\), which
simplifies to: \\[ \\cos 208^\\circ = \\cos (-28^\\circ) \\]",
"The cosine function is also even, meaning it is symmetric about the y-axis: \\[ \\cos (-
\\theta) = \\cos \\theta \\] Thus, \\[ \\cos (-28^\\circ) = \\cos 28^\\circ \\]",
"So, \\(n = 28^\\circ\\). Hence, the integer \\(n\\), \\(0 \\leq n \\leq 180\\), such that
\\(\\cos n^\\circ = \\cos 568^\\circ\\) is \\(n = 28\\). The answer is \\(\\boxed{28}\\)."

Figure 2: Data example of PROCESSBENCH. The label 2 denotes that the earliest error occurs in the 2nd
step (indexed from 0). For test cases with no errors, the labels are −1.
In this paper, we introduce PROCESSBENCH for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning. Figure 2 presents a data example. We prioritize several principles when
designing this benchmark:
• Problem difficulty and solution diversity.
PROCESSBENCH primarily covers competition- and
Olympiad-level math problems and utilizes various open-source language models to generate solu-
tions. This ensures both the difficulty of math problems and the diversity of solution styles, enabling
robust evaluation.
• Scale and accuracy. PROCESSBENCH consists of 3,400 test cases, with all solutions annotated with error
locations by multiple human experts. The large scale and expert annotation ensure the data quality
and the reliability of evaluation.
• Simplicity. PROCESSBENCH requires models to identify the earliest erroneous step occurring in the
solution, if any exists. This straightforward evaluation protocol enables easy adaptation for various
types of models, such as process reward models (PRMs) and critic models.
We conduct extensive evaluation on PROCESSBENCH, involving two types of models: process reward
models (PRMs) and critic models. For PRMs, we include multiple open-source PRMs (Wang et al., 2024;
Skywork, 2024; Xiong et al., 2024b) to assess the correctness of each reasoning step in the solution. For
critic models, we prompt general language models like Qwen (Yang et al., 2024a; Qwen, 2024a; Hui
et al., 2024) and GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to critique each solution step by step. We show that, despite
2

## Page 3

recent growing interest, existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems
beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models and our own trained PRM that is
straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset, which raises questions about the generalization
abilities and scalability of the current data synthesis methodologies used to build PRMs. In contrast,
general language models manifest non-trivial critique capabilities that can not only identify erroneous
steps but also provide detailed explanations. The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen,
2024b), has performed competitively with the proprietary GPT-4o model, while it still lags behind the
reasoning-specialized o1-mini (OpenAI, 2024). We hope PROCESSBENCH can catalyze future research
in automated reasoning process assessment, establishing crucial foundations for scalable oversight of
language models.

Related Work
There exist several benchmarks or datasets related to assessing language models’ reasoning process.
CriticBench (Lin et al., 2024) evaluates language models’ abilities to critique solutions and correct mistakes
in various reasoning tasks. MathCheck (Zhou et al., 2024) synthesizes solutions containing erroneous
steps using the GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021), in which language models are tasked with judging
the correctness of final answers or reasoning steps. PRM800K (Lightman et al., 2023) builds on the MATH
problems (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and annotates the correctness and soundness of reasoning steps in
model-generated solutions. It also has sparked a blooming of research interest in building process reward
models (PRMs) (Wang et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2024b;a).

PROCESSBENCH is distinguished from prior benchmarks or datasets in three key aspects, as highlighted
in Table 1. First, PROCESSBENCH primarily covers more challenging math problems with competition- or
Olympiad-level difficulty, which better fit the rapidly growing capabilities of modern language models.
Second, rather than relying on synthetic data, PROCESSBENCH leverages diverse model-generated
natural solutions and employs expert annotation to label erroneous steps, which ensures both real-world
applicability and label accuracy. Third, the large scale of PROCESSBENCH (3,400 test cases in total) enables
more comprehensive and robust evaluation.
There has also been extensive research on language models’ scalable oversight (Amodei et al., 2016;
Bowman et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2024) and studies on whether language models can identify the errors in
their own outputs. Lightman et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2024); Luo et al. (2024) propose to train specialized
reward models to supervise language models’ reasoning process (i.e., process reward models or PRMs).
Huang et al. (2023); Kamoi et al. (2024) argue that general language models struggle to identify and correct
their reasoning errors without external feedback. Saunders et al. (2022); McAleese et al. (2024) show
that language models can be trained to write informative critiques for both assisting human evaluation
and enabling self-refinement, which favorably scales with increased model capabilities (or model sizes).
We believe the improved capabilities of error identification will build strong foundations for language
models’ scalable oversight.

Benchmark Construction
3.1
Task Definition
As shown in Figure 2, given a math problem and a step-by-step solution, PROCESSBENCH requires
models to either identify the earliest-occurring error, or conclude that all steps are correct. Formally,
3

## Page 4

given a math problem P and its step-by-step solution S = {s0, ..., sn−1}, the task is to output an index
i ∈{−1, 0, ..., n −1}, where i = −1 indicates that all steps are correct, and i ≥0 indicates that the earliest
error occurs at step si.
Typically but non-inclusively, we consider a step as erroneous if it contains any of the following: (1)
Mathematical errors: incorrect calculations, algebraic manipulations, or formula applications. (2) Logical
errors: invalid deductions, unwarranted assumptions, or flawed reasoning steps. (3) Conceptual errors:
misunderstanding or misapplication of mathematical or problem concepts. (4) Completeness errors:
missing crucial conditions, constraints, or necessary justifications that affect the solution’s validity.
Beyond these types of errors, we encourage human annotators to determine the correctness of reasoning
steps based on their own expertise. We do not require human annotators to explicitly annotate error
types due to the intractability of intentional categorization.
Note that for steps after the first error, the meaning of their correctness may become ambiguous or
debatable: derivations based on incorrect premises can make sense, but still remain on a globally incorrect
reasoning path (Lightman et al., 2023). For instance, if step k contains an error in calculating x = 2, when
it should be x = 3, subsequent steps may follow valid algebraic rules but operate on an incorrect value
of x, making their individual correctness hard to determine. This is why PROCESSBENCH focuses on
identifying the earliest-occurring error in the reasoning process.
3.2
Data Collection
Problem Curation
We collect math problems from the test sets of four public and widely used datasets
in mathematical reasoning tasks: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Olympiad-
Bench (He et al., 2024), and Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024). Except for GSM8K, which consists of grade
school math problems, the other three datasets all contain problems with competition- or Olympiad-level
difficulty.
Solution Generation
We generate solutions using the widely used Qwen (Yang et al., 2024a; Qwen,
2024a; Yang et al., 2024b) and LLaMA (Dubey et al., 2024) series open-source models, resulting in twelve
distinct solution generators in total. This includes a wide range of model families, sizes, and downstream
task performance, leading to the high diversity of solution styles. Table 4 in Appendix B presents the
breakdown of language models used for PROCESSBENCH’s solution generation.
Solution Reformatting
In mathematical reasoning tasks, double line breaks (i.e., “\n\n”) are commonly
used to segment solution steps (or paragraphs). However, we observed inconsistent step granularity due
to varying solution styles and generation randomness. Some generated solutions frequently used double
line breaks, resulting in numerous short, logically incomplete steps, while others used them sparingly,
leading to lengthy paragraphs that combine multiple logical components. Such inconsistency in step
granularity (and potential improper step segmentation) would impede the standardization of human
annotation criteria.
To address this issue, we adopt a solution reformatting method to standardize the step granularity, through
which the segmented paragraphs can better correspond to logically complete and progressive reasoning
steps. Specifically, we first replace all the line breaks with white space, and then ask Qwen2.5-72B-
Instruct to insert double line breaks (i.e., segment paragraphs) while preserving the solution content.
Since we found that Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct sometimes alters the solution content (< 0.5%), we remove
those solutions whose final answers change after reformatting (although the content alteration may not
influence benchmark construction). Consequently, the reformatting method effectively unifies the step
granularity. Figure 6 in Appendix A presents an example of solution reformatting.
Expert Annotation
To ensure a balance between erroneous and correct solutions, we first use Qwen2.5-
72B-Instruct to verify the correctness of final answers in the model-generated solutions against the
reference answers. We then respectively sample solutions with correct or incorrect final answers for
subsequent annotation in a balanced way to avoid excessive concentration on solutions from either the
weakest or strongest models.
We recruit human experts with doctoral-level mathematical expertise for annotation, and all of them
are required to pass the mandatory proficiency examination and annotation tutorial. The annotators
are designated with the same task in § 3.1, i.e., identifying the earliest-occurring error in each solution.
However, we notice that the competition- or Olympiad-level math problems can still be challenging even
for doctoral students majoring in mathematics. According to the feedback from the annotators, although
they were not required to solve problems from scratch but rather to identify erroneous steps in presented
solutions, they would still become quite hesitant in their annotations when uncertain about the correct
solution approach, which affected both the annotation speed and quality. To ease the annotation difficulty,
4

## Page 5

we provide annotators with the reference solutions and answers from the original datasets, while we still
explicitly instructed them to inspect and verify the presented model-generated solutions step by step.
Each solution is initially assigned to three different experts. When the initial three annotators cannot
reach consensus, we increase the number of annotators until three of them agree on the same result. If an
agreement cannot be achieved within five annotators (e.g., annotation distribution of (2, 2, 1) or (2, 1, 1, 1)),
we discard this solution. This leads to an overall ∼30% discard rate throughout the entire annotation
process. We also discard the solutions where the final answers are incorrect (according to the reference
answers) but the human annotation results are correct. Although such cases are fairly rare (< 1%), they
are mostly concentrated in the OlympiadBench and Omni-MATH problems (i.e., Olympiad-level ones).
The agreement statistics in Table 2 further evidence that the more challenging problems usually need
more annotators to achieve the annotation agreement, particularly for those samples with incorrect final
answers. These results suggest the inherent challenge of our human annotation task.

Statistics
Table 2: Statistics of PROCESSBENCH. “% Process errors” denotes the proportion of samples with erroneous
reasoning steps (i.e., annotated as erroneous) among all the samples with correct final answers. “% ≥n
steps” denotes the proportion of samples whose solutions have ≥n steps (split by double line breaks).
“% 3/n agreement” denotes the proportion of samples where the three-annotator agreement is achieved
within n annotators, so (% 3/3) + (% 3/4) + (% 3/5) = 100%.

The resulting PROCESSBENCH has four subsets, consisting of 3,400 test cases in total. The detailed
statistics are shown in Table 2 and Table 4 (in Appendix B), and we also plot in Figure 3 the distribution
of error positions in erroneous samples. In general, the more challenging the problems, the more solution
steps the models generate, and incorrect solutions usually contain more steps than correct ones. However,
across all four subsets, a large proportion of errors occur in the earlier steps, such as steps 0-3 in GSM8K
and MATH, and steps 1-5 in OlympiadBench and Omni-MATH.

Figure 4: Process error ratios per models and subsets, computed as the proportions of samples annotated
as erroneous among all the samples with correct final answers (same as in Table 2). The models used for
solution generation slightly vary across different subsets, see Table 4 in Appendix B. We observe that no
particular models have notably higher process error rates, while the process error rates are consistently
higher on more difficult problems for all the models.
results reveal quite different numbers. Specifically, in the more challenging subsets like OlympiadBench
and Omni-MATH, a larger proportion of solutions with correct final answers still contain erroneous
steps. For instance, in OlympiadBench, 500−339
500
= 32.2% of solutions with correct final answers are found
to contain process errors, while in Omni-MATH this proportion is even higher ( 500−241

= 51.8%). In
contrast, these proportions in GSM8K and MATH are 200−193
200
= 3.5% and 500−406
500
= 18.8%, respectively.
In Figure 4, for each model used for solution generation, we plot the ratio of samples with erroneous
reasoning steps (i.e., annotated as erroneous) among all the samples with correct final answers. We observe
that the process error rates are consistently higher on more difficult problems. To our knowledge, our
work is the first to present evidence that on more challenging math problems, current language models
are more prone to making process errors even when reaching correct final answers. This also suggests
the underlying limitation of rule-based RL in mathematical reasoning (i.e., rewarding merely according
to the correctness of final answers) and further highlights the significance of identifying errors in the
reasoning process.

Evaluation
4.1
Setup
For each subset of PROCESSBENCH, we calculate the accuracies on erroneous and correct samples,
respectively, and additionally compute their harmonic mean as the F1 score. We primarily refer to F1
scores to compare model performance, as it balances model behaviors between being overly critical and
being incapable of identifying errors.
We consider two types of models in the evaluation on PROCESSBENCH: process reward models (PRMs) and
critic models.
Process Reward Models (PRMs)
As a recently focal topic, PRMs are proposed to assess and supervise
the intermediate steps in language models’ reasoning process (Lightman et al., 2023), thus naturally
falling in the scope of our research. In practice, PRMs are typically trained using the process labels
for intermediate reasoning steps, outputting either the correctness prediction or a scalar score for each
reasoning step during inference. Previous research usually evaluates PRMs based on their improvement
in the Best-of-N (BoN) performance of another language model that generates solutions. However, this
lacks a finer-grained inspection on their process assessment abilities, and the evaluation reliability can be
heavily affected by the underlying solution generation model.
Our evaluation includes several open-source PRMs: (1) Math-Shepherd (Wang et al., 2024), which obtains
the process label for each step via estimating the empirical probability of this step leading to the correct
final answer. (2) Two LLaMA-3.1-based PRMs from Xiong et al. (2024b), which roughly follow the training
methodology of Math-Shepherd but differ in the solution generation models and optimization objectives.
(3) Two Qwen2.5-Math-based PRMs recently released by Skywork (2024). (4) We also train a PRM by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the PRM800K dataset, namely Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K.
See Appendix C for its training details.

## Page 7

For the (1)(2)(4) PRMs, we extract the earliest erroneous step from their correctness predictions for
reasoning steps. For the (3) PRMs, which produce scalar scores for each reasoning step, we first transform
these scores into binary correctness predictions (using a threshold above which steps are considered as
correct), and then extract the earliest erroneous step as we do for (1)(2)(4). The transformation threshold
is determined as the one giving the highest F1 score on the GSM8K subset.
Critic Models
Critic models aim to provide feedback and critique to model-generated texts, non-
inclusively including verification, reflection, and correction or refinement. They have demonstrated
promising utility in achieving scalable oversight (Saunders et al., 2022; McAleese et al., 2024).
Training critic models for specific domains typically requires significant and specialized effort, which is
out of the scope of our work. Instead, we are more interested in the critique capabilities of general language
models. The task definition (§ 3.1) of PROCESSBENCH enables us to apply simple prompt engineering to
repurpose general language models as critic models. We show in Figure 7 in Appendix E the prompt
template we implement for our evaluation. Specifically, models are prompted to return the index of
the paragraph where the earliest error occurs as the final answer, similar to the conventional evaluation
protocol for mathematical reasoning tasks (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024b).
Our evaluation includes the widely-used Qwen2 (Yang et al., 2024a), Qwen2.5 (Qwen, 2024a), Qwen2.5-
Math (Yang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-Coder (Hui et al., 2024), and LLaMA-3 (Dubey et al., 2024) series
open-source models, as well as the recently released QwQ-32B-Preview reasoning model (Qwen, 2024b).
We also evaluate the proprietary GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) and o1-mini (OpenAI, 2024) models. We
report the performance of open-source models under majority voting over eight samplings, while we also
report their performance under greedy decoding in Table 9 in Appendix F. For the proprietary model
GPT-4o, we report the results under greedy decoding, while for o1-mini, we report the results under
single sampling as its API does not support customized decoding parameters.

erroneous and correct samples. See Table 5 and Table 7 for breakdown of evaluation results.

Alright, I've got this math problem to solve and a solution provided, but I need to review it
paragraph by paragraph to find any errors. The problem is to find the integer \(n\), where \(0
\leq n \leq 180\), such that \(\cos n^\circ = \cos 568^\circ\). Let's dive into the solution step
by step.
**Paragraph 0:**
The solution starts by recalling that the cosine function has a period of \(360^\circ\), which
means \(\cos \theta = \cos (\theta + 360k)\) for any integer \(k\). That's correct. Cosine repeats
every \(360^\circ\), so adding or subtracting multiples of \(360^\circ\) doesn't change the value
of the cosine.
**Paragraph 1:**
Given \(\cos 568^\circ\), the solution reduces this angle by subtracting \(360^\circ\) to get
\(208^\circ\), since \(568^\circ - 360^\circ = 208^\circ\). So, \(\cos 568^\circ = \cos
208^\circ\). That seems right. 208 degrees is within one cycle of \(0^\circ\) to \(360^\circ\).
**Paragraph 2:**
Now, the solution mentions that cosine is symmetric about \(180^\circ\), and states that \(\cos
\theta = \cos (180^\circ - \theta)\). Wait a minute, is that correct? Let me think about this.
Actually, cosine is symmetric about the y-axis, and the identity \(\cos \theta = \cos (-\theta)\)
reflects that. The identity \(\cos \theta = \cos (360^\circ - \theta)\) shows the symmetry about
\(360^\circ\), but symmetry about \(180^\circ\) isn't directly related to cosine's even property.
Hmm, maybe I need to recall some trigonometric identities here. Let's see, the cosine of an angle
in standard position is equal to the cosine of its reference angle, but with a sign depending on
the quadrant. 208 degrees is in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative.
Alternatively, there's the identity \(\cos (180^\circ + \theta) = -\cos \theta\), but that's not
directly applicable here.
Let me double-check the symmetry properties. Cosine is an even function, meaning \(\cos (-\theta)
= \cos \theta\), which shows symmetry about the y-axis. The identity \(\cos (360^\circ - \theta) =
\cos \theta\) shows symmetry every full cycle.
But the statement \(\cos \theta = \cos (180^\circ - \theta)\) isn't generally true. Let's test it
with a specific angle. For example, \(\theta = 30^\circ\): \(\cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2\), and
\(\cos (180^\circ - 30^\circ) = \cos 150^\circ = -\sqrt{3}/2\). These are not equal; in fact,
they're negatives of each other.
So, it seems there's an error in this paragraph. The correct identity involving \(180^\circ\) is
\(\cos (180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta\), not \(\cos \theta\).
Therefore, the earliest error occurs in paragraph 2.
**Final Answer**
\[ \boxed{2} \]

Results
We present the evaluation results in Table 3. Our observations are summarized as follows:
Generalization Across Difficulty
From GSM8K and MATH to OlympiadBench and Omni-MATH, with
the increased difficulty of math problems, we observe a consistent performance decline for all the models,
which suggests the common challenge of both PRMs and critic models in generalization abilities.
Comparison Between PRMs and Critic Models
We find that existing PRMs typically underperform
the top prompt-driven critic models even on the simpler GSM8K and MATH subsets, suggesting that
these PRMs struggle to indicate the correctness of the intermediate steps in mathematical reasoning.
Moreover, when moving toward the more challenging OlympiadBench and Omni-MATH subsets, PRMs
suffer from a more notable performance decline than critic models. This raises our concerns about the
generalization abilities and scalability of the current data synthesis methodologies used to build
PRMs. More specifically, current methodologies, as exemplified by Math-Shepherd (Wang et al., 2024),
measure the correctness of an intermediate step by estimating the empirical probability of this step
leading to the correct final answer. This kind of approach has two intuitive major issues: (1) The process
labels heavily depend on the language model used to generate solutions (i.e., highly “on-policy”), which
8

## Page 9

would naturally fail to indicate the correctness of reasoning steps generated by other models. (2) As
demonstrated in § 3.3, current language models are prone to making process errors even when reaching
correct final answers. This could substantially invalidate the estimated process labels, particularly on the
more challenging math problems. In contrast, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K, which is straightforwardly
fine-tuned on the fully human-annotated PRM800K training set, exhibits significantly stronger performance
and generalization ability than other PRMs.
Comparison Among Critic Models
Compared to PRMs, critic models can benefit from separate reason-
ing processes when critiquing solutions, as they can “think” more before indicating the correctness of each
solution step, which leads to their better performance in this error identification task. Within the same
model family, the error identification performance favorably scales with increased model sizes. Notably,
the recently released reasoning model QwQ-32B-Preview performs best among the open-source models
and is highly competitive with GPT-4o. It is noteworthy that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves more balanced
accuracies on erroneous and correct samples (see Table 5 and 7 in Appendix F). We show in Figure 5 an
example of critique generated by QwQ-32B-Preview to the test case in Figure 2, which not only identifies
the erroneous step but also provides the detailed thinking process and explanation. Nevertheless, QwQ-
32B-Preview still lags behind o1-mini, suggesting that although the gap in problem-solving performance
is getting closer between open-source and proprietary models, there still exists another large gap in their
critique capabilities.

Conclusion
We introduce the PROCESSBENCH benchmark for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning, characterized by its high problem difficulty and solution diversity, large scale,
rigorous human annotation, and simple evaluation protocol. Through extensive evaluation with existing
process reward models (PRMs) and prompt-driven critic models, we draw two main observations: (1)
Existing PRMs typically underperform critic models in identifying erroneous reasoning steps, and strug-
gle more to generalize to challenging math problems. (2) Open-source language models, as exemplified
by QwQ-32B-Preview, have demonstrated critique capabilities competitive with the proprietary model
GPT-4o, yet still lag behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini model. We envision PROCESSBENCH as
a cornerstone testbed for advancing automated reasoning process assessment, a critical step toward
achieving scalable oversight of language models.
Limitations
Despite our best efforts throughout the entire benchmark construction process (§ 3.2),
PROCESSBENCH may still contain inaccurate labels of error locations, particularly for the more chal-
lenging Olympiad-level math problems. Additionally, the solutions discarded in human annotation
(§ 3.2 may involve the particularly challenging problems, which could bias the problem distribution in
PROCESSBENCH, although such samples may have exceeded the capabilities of the human annotators in
our annotation task.

Example of Solution Reformatting
The given equation is of an ellipse in the standard form
\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,
\]
where $(h, k)$ is the center of the ellipse, $a$ is the semi-
major axis length, and $b$ is the semi-minor axis length.
In this case, the center of the ellipse is $(6, 3)$, $a = 5$,
and $b = 3$.
The foci of an ellipse are located along the major axis, which
is the line segment connecting the two vertices of the ellipse.
The distance from the center of the ellipse to each focus is
given by $\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$.
First, we calculate the distance from the center to each focus:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16}
= 4.
\]
Since the major axis of the ellipse is horizontal (because $a
> b$), the foci are located at a distance of 4 units to the
left and right of the center of the ellipse.
Therefore, the two foci are at $(6 \pm 4, 3) = (2, 3)$ and
$(10, 3)$.
The one with the larger $x$-coordinate is $(10, 3)$.
The answer is: $\boxed{(10, 3)}$.
The given equation is of an ellipse in
the standard form \[\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} +
\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\] where \((h,
k)\) is the center of the ellipse, \(a\)
is the semi-major axis length, and \(b\)
is the semi-minor axis length. In this
case, the center of the ellipse is \((6,
3)\), \(a = 5\), and \(b = 3\).
The foci of an ellipse are located along
the major axis, which is the line segment
connecting the two vertices of the
ellipse. The distance from the center of
the ellipse to each focus is given by
\(\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}\). First, we calculate
the distance from the center to each
focus: \[\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{5^2 -
3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4.\]
Since the major axis of the ellipse is
horizontal (because \(a > b\)), the foci
are located at a distance of 4 units to
the left and right of the center of the
ellipse. Therefore, the two foci are at
\((6 \pm 4, 3) = (2, 3)\) and \((10, 3)\).
The one with the larger \(x\)-coordinate
is \((10, 3)\). The answer is:
\(\boxed{(10, 3)}\).

Training Details of Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM800K is obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the PRM800K
training set. We replace the original language modeling head with a new reward modeling head that
outputs binary classification logits. The classification loss is computed at the second line break positions
in all the “\n\n”. We treat the original 1 and 0 labels in PRM800K as our positive labels, while -1 as
negative ones. To eliminate test data contamination, we also remove the PRM800K training samples that
have the same problems in PROCESSBENCH. The training was run on eight A100 80GB GPUs.
D
Inference Details
For solution generation in § 3.2, all the models are set with p = 0.9, t = 0.7. For majority voting evaluation
in § 4, we set p = 0.8, t = 0.7, k = 20 for Qwen2.5-Math-7/72B-Instruct to ensure their normal generation,
while all the other models are set with only p = 0.9. All the inference in the evaluation was run with
vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) on eight A100 80GB GPUs.
E
Prompt Template for Critic Model Evaluation
The following is a math problem and a solution (split into paragraphs, enclosed with tags and
indexed from 0):
[Math Problem]
...(math problem)...
[Solution]
<paragraph_0>
...(paragraph 0 of solution)...
</paragraph_0>
...
<paragraph_n-1>
...(paragraph n-1 of solution)...
</paragraph_n-1>
Your task is to review and critique the solution paragraph by paragraph. Once you identify an
error in a paragraph, return the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs. Otherwise,
return the index of -1 (which typically denotes "not found").
Please put your final answer (i.e., the index) in \boxed{}.

Table 6: For the two PRMs from Skywork (2024), we additionally adjust the threshold (§ 4.1) as the one
leading to the highest F1 score on each subset (i.e., each subset adopts a respective optimal threshold),
which can be viewed as the two PRMs’ upper bound performance on PROCESSBENCH. This table presents
the results on the GSM8K and MATH subsets, which are marginally higher than those in Table 5 that all
adopt the threshold selected on the GSM8K subset.
